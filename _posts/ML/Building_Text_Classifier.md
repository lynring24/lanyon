title: Building text classifier with machine learning
categories: ML
---

Recently I've been working on my graduation project with my team-mates. The project is about text classification and recommendation, so we had to look up articles and research papers.

####  Machine Learning
+ SVM (Support Vector Machine) :  usefull with handling small data
+ Naive Bayes classification

#### Deep learning and tools
+ ANN(Artifial Neural Network)
+ RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)
+ CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
+ MLP
+ Keras/Tensorflow

### What I've tried
1. Naive bayes classificaion
2. MLP with keras
