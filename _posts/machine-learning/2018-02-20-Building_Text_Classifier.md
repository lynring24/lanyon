title: Introduction of my graduation project
categories: ML
---

Recently I've been working on my graduation project with my team-mates.
It's an android applicaion which classifies and recommends text but none of us knew something to work on  so we had to look up some articles and research papers.

####  Machine Learning
+ SVM (Support Vector Machine) :  usefull with handling small data
+ Naive Bayes classification

#### Deep learning and tools
+ ANN(Artifial Neural Network)
+ RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)
+ CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
+ MLP
+ Keras/Tensorflow

### What Do we've done
1. Naive bayes classification
2. MLP classification with keras
3. content based recommendation
4. coordination based recommendation
5. word recommendation working with word2vec

I was working on classsfications mostly. First model was build with KoNLPy and the other was worked on Keras.
> keras는 tensorflow나 theano 위에서 작동하는 고수준 신경망이다.
